This homework was an attempt to create a simple visualization of the incidence of 8 common diseases among men and women. The idea was to create 8 circles, with a stroke-width representing the incidence of the disease in women, and the fill representing the incidence of disease in men.  


The comments in the code describe my general thought process and what I though each piece of code would do/produce.
